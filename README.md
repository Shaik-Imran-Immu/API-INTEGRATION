*DESCRIPTION*: [Task - 1]

This project focuses on the integration of a public API into a responsive webpage, demonstrating the practical application of real-time data fetching and display. The goal is to create a fully functional, interactive webpage that connects to a freely accessible public API such as News API and dynamically presents relevant data to users in a clean, intuitive format. This task blends frontend development skills with the basics of API interaction and asynchronous programming, offering a comprehensive look into how modern web applications communicate with external data services.

Objective:
The core objective is to design and develop a responsive, user-friendly webpage that retrieves data from a public API and displays it in a visually appealing and meaningful way. The application must handle asynchronous requests, manage data rendering efficiently, and respond appropriately to user interaction or errors. Developers are encouraged to apply modern development practices and tools, including HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript

Key Features:

1. API Selection:

  * NewsData.io (latest news headlines)

2. Data Fetching:
   The application must send an HTTP request to the selected API endpoint and process the returned JSON or XML data using JavaScript (or a frontend framework). The fetch should occur either on page load or in response to a user action.

3. Dynamic Display:
   Data retrieved from the API must be parsed and dynamically rendered in the webpage without requiring a page reload. This may involve DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

4. Responsive Design:
   The webpage should be responsive, meaning it must work effectively on various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile. Developers may utilize media queries or responsive frameworks to ensure a seamless user experience.

5. Error Handling:
   The application should gracefully handle possible issues, such as network errors, API downtime, or invalid user inputs. User-friendly messages or fallback content should be displayed in such cases.

6. UI/UX Considerations:
   Clear visual hierarchy, loading indicators (e.g., spinner during data fetch), and simple navigation will enhance the user experience. The data should be formatted for readability and presented using cards.

Deliverables:

* A fully functional HTML/CSS/JavaScript-based webpage that integrates with a public API.
* The webpage must fetch live data from the API and render it dynamically.
* Responsive layout adaptable to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* All code must be clean, well-commented, and organized.

Evaluation Criteria:

* Successful integration with the selected API
* Dynamic data rendering without manual reloads
* Responsiveness and UI/UX quality
* Code readability, structure, and commenting
* Proper error handling
